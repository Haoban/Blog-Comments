# Blog-Comments
Comments for [My Personal Blogs](https://haoban.github.io/)

The personal page repo is set as private, so I have to create a new repo to backup my blog comments.

It works on [gitalk](https://github.com/gitalk) comment component which is based on Github Issue and Preact.

For each post/page which uses the gitalk comment component, I have to create a new issue.

The issue is based on the label (normally the page's name), and the owner of repo have to initialize the comment for each page. (Create a new issue with unique label in Blog Comments repo.)
